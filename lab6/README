Just type 'make' to compile, and run ./Cuda1DFDWave [blockSize] [max # of blocks]
to run.  For example, run ./Cuda1DFDWave 512 50
(Note: The makefile is setup to compile on minuteman/polaris).

This will produce raw numerical data for the wave at a few preset timesteps 
in the /output directory.  Running the provided python script with 
'python makePlots.py' will display the output in graphical form.
We can verify that the CPU and GPU methods produce the same plots of the
wave, but the GPU implementation runs must faster.
